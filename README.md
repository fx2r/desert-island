#README

#this is a simple JavaScirpt RPG to escape a desert island that you are stranded on - enjoy!

#each round you can choose between two actions, depending on your choice you either loose or continue your journey on the desert island

#the <main id="scene"> contains the scenes that are inserted (apart from the first one) using 'document.getElementById("scene").innerHTML' by calling the assigend functions on 'onclick', thus replacing the previous scenes

#in case of losing, a gameOver function will be inserted into the <main>
#the onclick='location.reload() refreshes the page, bringing you back to when you first stranded on the desert island.
